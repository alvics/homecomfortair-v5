              Ducted systems can be customised to suit your requirements. If
              you're looking to control the temperature of the entire home, then
              a ducted air conditioning system will be the most effective and
              efficient way. It's more effective in cooling or heating your home
              by maintaining a consistent temperature throughout multiple rooms
              in a discreet and quiet way. However, if you're only looking to
              cool or heat one or two rooms in your home, a wall mounted
